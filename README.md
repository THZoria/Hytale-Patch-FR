A French language translation for **Hytale Early Access**.

## ⚠️ Important – Manual Installation Required

> **Language files work differently than standard mods.  
> A manual installation is therefore required.**

⚠️ Some parts of the translation were initially assisted by AI (**Gemini 3.0**).  
However, the goal of this project is to progressively revise everything so that the translation becomes **100% human-made**.

- ❌ The logo was **NOT generated by AI**
- 🎨 Logo by **Inovadiax** — thank you!
- 📦 All items and in-game texts have been translated
